Please note that due to issues in A2, 
event 3 of megaCal1.ics and megaCalFolded1.ics will result in the server crash.
While it would be ideal to address the issue to prevent the crash, 
unfortunately, I have not been able to.
As a result, I ask you, the user, to avoid extracting optional properties for
events 3 and greater from these files and avoid viewing their alarms as well.
In addition, I ask that you not add events to these files as a crash will occur as well.

Thank you.
